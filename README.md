# Don't Kill the President!
**Follow your dreams to become an amateur garage scientist, and achieve your goals of... poisoning the president?
Though, watch out, as mixing the wrong ingredients might lead to unexpected results...
Will you successfully figure out the secret formula before anyone catches you?**

This game was made for the [Minestom](https://github.com/minestom/minestom) August 2024 Game Jam, themed **Color Changes Everything**.
At first I wanted to make the 1000000000th Splatoon clone, but then the idea for this game popped up.
I hope it is fun, because I have no clue will be. Also, in true game jam style is an absolute minimum viable product, but who cares.
Do not look at code for your own sanity. Thanks.
